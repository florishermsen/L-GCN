# L-GCN
End-to-end learning from complex multigraphs with latent-graph convolutional networks.

### Dependencies
See `requirements.txt` or `environment.yml` (conda).

### Data
The synthetic transaction networks can be found in the `/data` folder as zipped data files in pickle format. Testing can be done with files followed by a `_tiny` suffix. These contain less than 500 nodes and around 1250 transactions.

### Models
Model code can be found in `model.py`.
Example notebook can be found in the main directory.
